This directy is for using AVD directly with EOS, bypassing CVP entirely. Normally we would use CVP, as there's lots of advantages. 

However, CVP is sometimes difficult to home lab, as it requires 16 cores even for the lab version (which most people don't have in their home lab). 

The build, document, and test playbooks are the same. Only the deploy model is different. 

The data models are modified as when you deploy to EOS directly, the *entire* configuration needs to be built. If you're missing something like the management interface, you'll lock yourself out of the switch.

You'll need to edit the FABRIC.yml file. Go to the bottom, and replace the SSH key in the file with your SSH key. You can use the command <tt>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</tt> to show your ATD SSH key. 

The password in the SHA_512 is "arista" from now on. You can change that of course, just be sure to change it in the inventory file as well.
